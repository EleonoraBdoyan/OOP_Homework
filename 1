# Class and Static Methods:
# Create a class Math with class methods add() and multiply(), and a static method square().
# Implement the methods to perform their respective operations on two numbers.
# Create a program that uses the Math class to add, multiply, and square some numbers.

Properties:
# Create a class Person with properties name and age.
# Implement methods to set and get the values of the properties.
# Create a program that creates a Person object, sets its name and age, and then prints its values.
